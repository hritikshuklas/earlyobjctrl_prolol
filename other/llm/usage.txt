Weaknesses and Next Steps

While we can make rough estimates as to how control of these neutral objectives helps a team's odds of winning, it does not show the whole picture. There are simply too many factors to account for to say for certain if a strategy is good. Moreover, these strategies won't last forever; League is constantly evolving, and metas might look very different even in the same season of pro play.

League is a very complex game which evolves constantly , from new patches that release every two weeks, changes to the map and structure of the arena that players compete in, new items being introduced or reworked, to new champions being added to the game as well as champion reworks. Something in League changes every two weeks, which influences the overall meta of the game as the season progresses through the year. A game from 2023 will look nothing like a game being played in 2024 - there simply have been too many changes which forces teams to adapt their play style or completely change them. Another point to consider is because of the constantly evolving meta, what was good before might not be good anymore. 

Other than the game itself, the skill of each individual player and how the players work together as a team also changes how a team approaches the game. A team might exploit a single person on the opposing team to gain an advantage, or play a strategy that counters their opponents strategy. Sometimes players just have an off day and don't perform as well as they usually do. Some players perform extremely well in certain metas, but fall flat in others. Early game focused teams might ignore the dragon and exploit the herald to snowball the game hard and never capture the Baron. Teams who play for the late game might emphasize drake stacking more than others. And these strategies might change for the same team from game to game.

Weaknesses and Next Steps

While our analysis provides valuable insights into how control of neutral objectives impacts a team's odds of winning, it's important to acknowledge that it only offers a partial view of the complex dynamics at play. Numerous factors influence the outcome of a match, making it challenging to definitively label a strategy as effective. Moreover, the transient nature of League of Legends ensures that strategies are subject to constant evolution. The game undergoes frequent updates with new patches every two weeks, alterations to the map layout, item changes, champion additions, and reworks. As a result, the meta can shift dramatically within the span of a single season of professional play. What worked well in the past may no longer hold true in the current landscape.

Beyond the game's mechanics, individual player skill and team dynamics play significant roles in shaping gameplay strategies. Teams may exploit weaknesses in their opponents' lineup or adapt their strategies to counter specific playstyles. Variability in player performance can also impact the outcome of matches, with some players excelling in certain metas while struggling in others. Additionally, teams may adopt different strategic approaches based on their strengths and preferences. For instance, early-game-focused teams may prioritize Rift Herald control to snowball their advantage, while late-game-oriented teams may prioritize dragon stacking. Moreover, strategies may vary from game to game within the same team as they adapt to the changing dynamics of each match.

Moving forward, it's crucial to recognize the dynamic nature of League of Legends and the multifaceted factors that influence gameplay outcomes. Further research and analysis are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of effective strategies and adaptability in response to the evolving meta and player dynamics.

Weaknesses and Next Steps

Our analysis helps us understand how controlling neutral objectives affects a team's chances of winning. But there's more to winning than just that. League of Legends changes all the time, with updates every two weeks and new stuff added regularly. This means strategies that work today might not work tomorrow. Also, how good each player is and how they work together matter a lot. Sometimes, teams can take advantage of weaknesses in the other team's lineup, or they might have to change their plan depending on what the other team is doing. Players can also have good days and bad days, and some might be better at certain parts of the game than others. Teams have different ways of playing too. Some focus on winning early, while others wait until later. And sometimes, the same team changes their strategy from game to game.

In the future, we need to remember that League of Legends is always changing, and there are many factors that affect how teams play and win. We'll need to keep studying and learning to understand it better.

Help me write an abstract and title for my paper with the following introduction and results:

Introduction

League of Legends has had one of the most popular esports scene in the history of gaming. The 2023 LoL World Championship held in South Korea had the highest viewership of any esports event ever, with viewership peaking at 6.4 million concurrent viewers [@worldsviewership].  However, at the same time, many viewers have voiced their opinions about the current state of the game. Even though neutral objectives such as the Rift Herald, Elemental Drakes as well as the iconic Baron Nasher are important to the game's structure and strategies implemented by teams across the world, many viewers are claiming that the meta has become stale and boring because of the objective focused gameplay many teams have adapted, leading to slow and calculated gameplay instead of the volatile and explosive gameplay people tune in for [@objfocusedboring]. 

This paper aims to find out if at the highest levels of play, focusing on these objectives matter at all or are pro players fighting for negligible advantages. In particular, the focus of this paper will be on early control of these objectives. By analysing games played in Tier 1 League championships around the world, our aim is to see if a team's control on the first spawn of these neutral objectives influences their odds of winning the match. We want to determine how big, if any, do these objectives influence a team's ability to win a game. 

Another decision that players have to make in the early game is whether they want to prioritize the Rift Herald over Elemental Drakes. Both spawn around the same time on the map but on the opposite ends, leading to teams often needing to give one up for the other. This has been a popular subject of debate amongst the community for years [@riftordragon]. By finding out how each of these objectives effect the outcome of the game, we aim to see which objective teams should focus on between the two.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:

@sec-data explores the dataset and the variables within it used for the study

@sec-model explains our models setup and our assumptions going into the study

@sec-results explores our findings in detail

I used R [@citeR], along with multiple packages to aid in the data analysis and modelling. More particularly, the packages tidyverse [@tidyverse], dplyr [@citeDplyr], tidyr [@citeTidyr] and arrow [@citeArrow] were used for data acquisition, testing and cleaning. The package rstanarm [@citeRstanarm] was used for modelling, and ggplot2 [@citeGgplot2], knitr [@citeKnitr] and modelsummary [@citeModelsummary] were used for data visualization.

What was done

Objectives are an important part of League of Legends, and are important part of strategies adopted by teams in the professional scene of the game. The objective of this paper was to see how much early control of these objectives influenced a team's odds of winning in the Tier 1 professional leagues around the world. This was done by obtaining match data for all Tier 1 professional matches held in 2023 from Oracle's Elixir, a popular website among esport professionals, analysts and journals. Initial exploratory data analysis suggested that teams who won more often than not had early control of these objectives. This difference was much greater when it came to Baron Nasher when compared to both the Rift Herald and Drakes. Logistic regression modelling was then used to formalize this discovery, revealing a clear trend that aligned with our initial hypothesis: early control of Rift Herald, Elemental Drakes, and Baron Nasher progressively enhances a team's odds of winning, with the magnitude of this increase growing in the order they are listed.

Early Rift Herald Control Is Effective, but Not the Best Strategy

Early control of the Rift Herald is overall beneficial for teams, and increases a team's odds of winning. It is however, not as great as one might think. An increase of 0.485 log odds from the intercept value of -2.168 increases a team's probability from 10.27% to 15.67%. This can be explained by how Rift Herald works. It helps teams break down towers faster in the early game and accelerate one of the players into a greater advantage. It is up to this player then to use this edge to propel other players on their team forward to make a bigger advantage for the team as a whole. Failure to capitalize on this lead can result in this lead diminishing over time - even if the player maintains this lead for themselves, its value diminishes over time as the game goes on. Worst case scenario, the enemy makes up for their deficit by just playing well and any advantage gained from the Rift Herald is lost. Therefore, while it does provide an advantage, it is not significant enough compared to others.

Early Drake Control Appears to be Better Than Rift Herald

Early Drake control increases a team's log odds of winning by 0.903. It is not as high as one might expect, due to how Drakes work in League of Legends. A team must keep stacking drakes to utilize their full potential. Early Drake control can help a team get a head start towards stacking or delay the opposition's strategy of Drake stacking. Early Drake control can therefore hurt an opposition by delaying their plans or by fast-tracking your own progress.

Early Drake control does prove to be more advantageous than the Rift Herald, by almost double the log odds. Compared to the Rift Herald, which only bumps up a team's chances of winning to 15.67%, getting early drake control increases these odds to 22.01% - much more significant than the Rift Herald. There are too many factors to account for to say definitively that early drake control is objectively better than the Rift Herald, however, it does seem so that for Season 13 of Tier 1 League of Legends, Early Drake control provided a greater advantage than Early Herald control.

Securing First Baron Nasher Often Leads to Victory

Riot Games make balance changes to the game every two weeks, which influences the overall meta of the game as the season progresses through the year. Strategies that work today may not work tomorrow. Games played even a week apart may not be playing under the same meta anymore - there simply too many changes which forces teams to adapt their play style or completely change them.

Other than the game itself, the skill of each individual player and how the players work together as a team also changes how a team approaches the game. A team might exploit a single person on the opposing team to gain an advantage, or play a strategy that counters their opponents strategy. Early game focused teams might ignore the drakes completely and focus completely on the Rift Herald if it aligns with their play style more - the game might end before the Baron even spawns. Teams who play for the late game might emphasize drake stacking more than others and might ignore the first Baron spawn as their team hasn't finished powering up yet. Moreover, these strategies might change for the same team from game to game.

Moving forward, it is important to recognize that League of Legends is always changing, and there are many factors that affect how teams play and win. We'll need to keep studying and learning to understand it better.
